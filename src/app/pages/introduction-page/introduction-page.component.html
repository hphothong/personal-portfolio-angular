    I would first like to thank you for taking a look at my projects! The main
    goal in coding all of these projects is to gain personal experience and
    expand my knowledge base. There are many different fields in computer
    science, and I am determined to learn the important basics for each of them.
    I say "the important basics" because it is simply not possible to learn
    everything about software, however, it is possible to abstract our thought
    to the concepts of why each topic exists. These high-level constructs are
    how many experienced developers make important design decisions, and I aim
    to do the same.

    I originally started this portfolio website using React. I liked how
    flexible the framework allowed the developer to be, however, there were many
    instances where I did not know the best practices. Like I mentioned before,
    I usually create a project to learn something new, but the excess freedom
    was causing my development time to double. That was my first attempt at
    using a web framework to generate a responsive website. After creating
    version 1.0 of the website, I quickly realized that there are other
    frameworks that could help me build a responsive app as well (e.g., Vue and
    Angular). I decided to use the Angular framework because many enterprise
    companies use this framework, and it restricts the developers to a
    particular convention for coding. This is the sturdy base that I needed to
    really get this project off the ground.

    I plan on keeping this website up to date, but we all know that life can get
    in the way. That is why I am showing a timestamp along with my coding
    challenges. In the near future, I plan to add more content to the page, so
    keep checking back! If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free
    to reach out to me via email. I am always excited to share the computer
    science passion with others!
